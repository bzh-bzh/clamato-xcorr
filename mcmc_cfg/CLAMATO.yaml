# Prior model parameters.
# Right now, feed in the best model-grid point. This has to be in the model grid!
# We determine the sigma of the prior Gaussian by taking the difference between this and the next largest parameter in the grid.
# Not used in the prior right now! We only use to initialize walker positions in a ball/ellipse around this point.
